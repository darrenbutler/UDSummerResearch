# June 10 - 15, 2019
## Week Summary
Overall, it was a good week. I'm much more accustomed to the ins and outs of the project. I need to put a bit more time into the python course and skip over some minor details. Next week, I need to revisit how to conduct interviews in preparation for the mock interview with Luke.

## Objectives
1. Reinforce understanding of Pedal
2. Reinforce understanding of CS Education research and project methodology  
3. Gain fluency in essential aspects of Dr.Bart's Intro Course and Python programming language
4. Establish habit of writing in journal

### Tasks:
:heavy_check_mark: = Completed
1. Meet with Dr. Bart :heavy_check_mark:
2. Create repository for reflective journal :heavy_check_mark:
3. Read Luke's Disseration Protocol :heavy_check_mark:
4. Write key takeaway's from Pedal paper :heavy_check_mark:

### Additional notes:
I need to create a schedule for myself.

## Tuesday June 11th, 2019
### Tasks:
1. Meet with Dr. Bart to discuss Luke's Prelim and Pedal Paper
2. Meet with Luke and Dr. Bart on Sype to discuss interview protocol

### Additional notes:
Moving forward, I need to minimize first half of protocol and expand the final question. Interview protocol should reveal professor's workflow, model of feedback (what they consider feedback and how they give it), and what they need to give students useful feedback). Reading Luke's protocol and reading over qualitative methods should help.

## Wednesday June 12th, 2019
### Tasks:
1. Read qualitative methods chapter in Computing Educaition Handbook
2. Reread research study plan
3. Researched artifact and contextual inquiry
4. Trouble shooted python course

### Additional notes:
So far the qualitative methods chapter, hasn't been as useful as hoped in developing interview protocol. Maybe futher reading in analysis will be more useful in the future. Since artificats are things made by research participants and the code learning how to analyze accounts and activities may be more helpful, as professors give feedback on the prepared code.

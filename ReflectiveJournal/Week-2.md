### Additional notes:
Data Collection Methods:
Accounts: use of language in human activity to carry out activities
Instructor’s Accounts of giving feedback and instructional design
Artifacts: objects intentionally produced by research participants 
In this study: pseudocode created to deliver feedback to students
Activities: Actions taken on by research participants:
This study’s activities: Participants giving feedback on incorrect student code

Data analysis:
Thick Description: explaining coherences of meaning to an audience. It provides an account for what might otherwise seem strange to an outsider but normal to an insider
When to apply: When a researcher seeks to understand what actions take place by which individuals within a particular context given its unique history, tools, resources, and the meaning and motives of the actions as understood by those who do them
Possible application to project: If unexpected feedback is given in response to the code snippet, it may prompt further explanation. Is there anything that may seem strange to someone who is not in computing education?
Inductive Categorization: The use of names categories for grouping things
When to apply: Tring to understand what kinds or types subdivide the object of study like an experience or  artifact e.g “What are the different ways in which students conceive of programming and learning to program?”
Possible application to project: Create a coding manual for concepts that may be brought up in the interviews. What are the kinds of features that should be in Pedal to help professors easily give automatic feedback? What are the features professors believe should be in automatic feedback systems?
Ethnographic Adequacy:  Analyzing language used to sustain practices between the person to self or person to another. How language supports a certain task.
When to apply: Understanding how a situation is organized and sustained. (How do professors communicate feedback?)
Possible application to project: Analyzing the language used when professors give feedback to the incorrect student code
Case Comparison: 

### Complted mock interview with Dr. Bart
After the interview, I realized there was more need to focus on the feedback process, in partcular how professors deliver their feedbakc (language used, concepts first addressed, how they integrate feedback into future design, how students respond) and prioir experiences with other automatic feedback and autograding tools.

I listening to the recording, I revised the protocol accordingly.

# Week 3 June 24 - 29, 2019
## Week Summary

## Objectives

## Monday 
### Tasks:
1. Created version 4 of the interview protocol.
### Additional notes:
To focus more on how professors would use a flexible automatic feedback system, I included a demonstration of their feedback process in the interview protocol. For time, it would be best to minimize the samples. However, it is important to note which feedback they would offer first to students to determine which form of type of feedback should be given priority (addressed first) in students programs.

## Tuesday 
### Tasks:
1. Scheduled Mock Interview with Luke
### Additional notes:
Inductive Categorization seems to be the optimal way forard to analyze the interviews. Taking note of the research questions:
1. Transcribe interviews and read transcripts
2. Mark all text sections relating to a specific phenomenon 
3. Enter sections into a software tool that facilitates coding of the text liek Atlas.ti or NVivo
4. In the software, browse through the text, add comments, mark quotes that display a phenomenon relating to the research question

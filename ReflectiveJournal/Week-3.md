# Week 3 June 24 - 29, 2019
## Week Summary

## Objectives

## Monday 
### Tasks:
1. Created version 4 of the interview protocol.
### Additional notes:
To focus more on how professors would use a flexible automatic feedback system, I included a demonstration of their feedback process in the interview protocol. For time, it would be best to minimize the samples. However, it is important to note which feedback they would offer first to students to determine which form of type of feedback should be given priority (addressed first) in students programs.

## Tuesday 
### Tasks:
1. Scheduled Mock Interview with Luke
### Additional notes:
Inductive Categorization seems to be the optimal way forard to analyze the interviews. Taking note of the research questions:
1. Transcribe interviews and read transcripts
2. Mark all text sections relating to a specific phenomenon 
3. Enter sections into a software tool that facilitates coding of the text liek Atlas.ti or NVivo
4. In the software, browse through the text, add comments, mark quotes that display a phenomenon relating to the research question
5. Add labels to identify interpretation of each marked quote
6. Develop and describe cataegories 

## Wednesday 
### Tasks:
1. Completed Module 3 in Python course: I'd like to expedite my progress in the python course. This is today's primary focus. I will also follow up with Dr. Barmaki.
2. Arranged a meeting to discuss qualitative analysis with Dr. Kataria from Midwestern State University
### Additional notes:
SUGGESTION: The interface for BlockPy may need to be more humanistic. I realized I felt disconnected from the enviorment as I have other learning enviornments because there is no face to see or human-like prescence. I found myself not being as drawn to the course as other online course's I've taken. After going to Udacity for a change in pace I realized the I was more engaged because I saw the instructor's face.

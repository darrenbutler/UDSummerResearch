## Overall Research Question
How should the API of Pedal be designed to make it easy for instructors to create automatic feedback for programming problems at varying levels of complexity (e.g., little practice problems all the way up to complex projects)?

## Additional questions
1. What mistakes do students make?
2. What misconceptions can we under from those mistakes?
3. How can we programmatically identify those misconceptions?
4. What feedback can we deliver to correct those misconceptions?
5. **How can we empower instructors to construct those feedback rules?**
